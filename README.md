#### 2. AI-Powered Triage Systems

AI-powered triage systems assess patient symptoms and prioritize treatment based on the severity of conditions. These systems utilize natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze patient records, vital signs, and symptoms, facilitating quicker and more accurate triage decisions. By doing so, AI helps in reducing patient wait times and ensuring that critical cases receive immediate attention.

#### 6. The Significance and Mechanism of AI in Emergency Medicine

This section elucidates the workflow of AI in Emergency Medicine (EM), focusing on its significance and mechanisms.

##### 6.1 AI-Based Predictive Modelling

Predictive modelling is a logical fit for AI in the medical field, where various AI systems predict diseases and other unfavorable outcomes. AI has been particularly beneficial in emergency care. Researchers have used decision trees (DTs), logistic regression (LR), and gradient-boosted machines (GBM) to forecast hospital admissions using emergency department (ED) data . For instance, a web-based application employing data mining and machine learning (ML) techniques provides real-time estimations of future ED visits . Data from outpatient clinics can also enable population-level risk assessments, with AI playing a pivotal role.

A clinical decision tool developed by researchers predicts which patients are likely to require readmission to the ED within 72 hours . Using patient-specific data, ED staff can anticipate readmissions, allowing them to improve care and provide further instructions to reduce such occurrences. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been used to predict the behavior of infants and toddlers with bronchiolitis, although accurately estimating the duration of hospital stays remains challenging . ANNs have also been developed to predict injuries in the craniocervical junction of trauma patients  and the occurrence of acute coronary syndromes . Researchers have used neural networks, among other techniques, to construct models for predicting mortality and acute morbidity .

The advent of electronic health records has facilitated predictive modelling for complex and extensive data sets. However, traditional LR becomes difficult when independent variables outnumber observations . Researchers have addressed this by employing variable selection and ranking techniques to identify predictive characteristics, enhancing the forecasting of adverse cardiac events in ED patients . Machine learning has proven more effective than clinical evaluations in predicting in-hospital mortality for ED patients with sepsis .

##### 6.2 AI-Based Patient Monitoring

Advances in sensor technology and computational capacity have made continuous patient monitoring a reality. Researchers have demonstrated wireless systems for monitoring unattended ED patients . One study developed and assessed an integrated monitoring system in the ED, which included Personal Digital Assistants and bedside monitors communicating with a unified system . Comparing a traditional Early Warning System (EWS) with an AI-based EWS, researchers highlighted the efficacy of automated patient assessments using electronic health records and AI methodologies. Integrating AI characteristics into interdisciplinary patient monitoring systems has shown benefits, particularly in managing physiological data like electrocardiography in emergency contexts  .

##### 6.3 AI-Based ED Operations

Efficient management of resources and patient flow is essential in the ED. Researchers have predicted ED workload using time series analysis, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), to aid resource planning . An agent-based simulation program evaluated the impact of different physician staffing arrangements on ED crowding . Diagnostic decision support systems are crucial for proper patient triage in the ED. Data mining techniques, like Naive Bayes and the C4.5 algorithm, have been used to assess patient severity , and machine learning techniques have predicted staff positioning related to the triage of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients . Natural Language Processing (NLP) and ML algorithms have automated the outcome categorization of ED computed tomography reports for both adult and pediatric patients  .

AI and ML methods have been routinely incorporated into ED procedures. Machine learning-based electronic triage systems have been found to outperform traditional methods in differentiating patients with respect to clinical outcomes . Deep learning triage and acuity scores have been validated using large national datasets, showing versatility and application in diverse contexts, including prehospital emergency medical services . Web-based interfaces utilizing machine and deep learning technologies have linked acute abdominal pain to ESI scores with increased accuracy .

In summary, AI-based predictive modelling, patient monitoring, and ED operations significantly enhance emergency medicine by improving diagnostic accuracy, resource management, and patient outcomes. These advancements demonstrate AI's potential to transform emergency medical services and highlight areas for further development and integration.
